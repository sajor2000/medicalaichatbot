   - Build your differential diagnosis

3. **Conduct Your Interview** (Voice Mode)
   - Click "Voice" tab
   - Click "Start Voice Mode"
   - Allow microphone access
   - Speak your questions naturally
   - Listen to the patient's verbal responses

4. **Monitor Your Performance**

   - **Completeness:** Did you elicit all key information?
   - **Empathy:** Did you show compassion and explain things?
   - **Facts:** How many key details did you uncover? (goal: 11/11)

5. **Tips for Success**
   - Ask specific, focused questions
   - Use OPQRST framework for pain assessment
   - Introduce yourself and establish rapport
