### Cost Analysis (100 students/month)

**Text Mode Only**: ~$22/month
- Azure OpenAI gpt-4o: ~$22
- Vercel Hosting: $0 (free tier)
- Vercel KV: $0 (free tier)

**With Voice Mode** (when approved): ~$122-172/month
- Azure Realtime API: +$100-150
- Total estimated: $122-172/month

## 🔧 Code Quality Review (MCP Context7)

### Next.js Best Practices ✅
- ✅ Proper Edge runtime configuration
- ✅ SSE streaming format with correct headers
- ✅ Environment variables scoped correctly (NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client)
- ✅ API routes follow Next.js conventions
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled

### React Best Practices ✅
- ✅ useEffect dependencies properly declared
- ✅ Cleanup functions in useRef/useEffect
- ✅ No setState in render
- ✅ Proper state updater functions
- ✅ Component memoization where needed

### Security ✅
- ✅ API keys in environment variables (not committed)
- ✅ .gitignore configured correctly
- ✅ Edge runtime for API routes
- ✅ Session data encrypted (Vercel KV)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Current State
1. **Voice Mode**: Code complete but requires Azure content filter approval
   - Expected timeline: 2-4 weeks
   - Workaround: Text mode fully functional
   - No changes needed when approved

2. **Session Storage**: Using in-memory fallback locally
   - Production uses Vercel KV
   - No data loss with proper Vercel KV setup

3. **Concurrent Users**: Limited by Azure quota
   - Text mode: 100+ concurrent (Edge Functions)
   - Voice mode: Depends on Azure capacity
