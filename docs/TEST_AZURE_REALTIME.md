# Azure Realtime API Test Results

## Current Status
- ✅ Deployment exists: `gpt-realtime` (Status: Succeeded)
- ❌ API returning 404 on Realtime endpoint
- ✅ Text mode working perfectly with `gpt-4o`

## Tested Endpoints

### Endpoint 1: cognitiveservices.azure.com (Your provided endpoint)
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://prodkmnlpopenaieastus.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/realtime?api-version=2024-10-01-preview&deployment=gpt-realtime' \
  -H 'api-key: YOUR_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-realtime","voice":"alloy"}'
```
**Result**: `{"error":{"code":"404","message": "Resource not found"}}`

## Possible Issues

### Issue 1: Realtime API Not Using REST
The Azure Realtime API might use **WebRTC/WebSocket** protocol, not REST POST.

According to Azure documentation, the Realtime API uses:
- WebRTC for audio streaming
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for control messages
- NOT traditional REST POST endpoints

### Issue 2: Wrong API Version
Try different API versions:
- `2024-10-01-preview` (current)
- `2024-12-01-preview` (newer)
- `2024-08-01-preview` (older)

### Issue 3: Deployment Region Restrictions
The `gpt-realtime` model may only work in specific Azure regions:
- East US 2
- Sweden Central
- West US

Your resource is in: **East US** - this might not support Realtime API yet.

## Recommended Solutions

### Solution 1: Use Azure OpenAI Studio to Test (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to: https://oai.azure.com/
2. Sign in with your Azure account
3. Go to "Chat playground"
4. Select your deployment: `gpt-realtime`
5. Click "Enable voice" toggle
6. Try speaking - if it works, the deployment is fine
7. If it doesn't work, the deployment needs to be recreated in a supported region

### Solution 2: Check Azure Portal for Realtime API Support
1. Go to: https://portal.azure.com
2. Navigate to your resource: `prodkmnlpopenaieastus`
3. Check "Model deployments" → "gpt-realtime"
4. Look for any warnings or restrictions
5. Check if "Realtime API" is listed as a capability

### Solution 3: Use Regular Chat Endpoint with Audio (Workaround)
If Realtime API is not available, we can use the standard chat completions API with:
- Speech-to-text for student input
- Text-to-speech for AI patient output
- This is slower but works everywhere

Would work like:
1. Student speaks → Azure Speech Services converts to text
2. Text sent to `gpt-4o` chat API
3. Response converted to audio → Played back to student

**Cost**: ~$0.02-0.05 per interview (much cheaper than Realtime)
**Latency**: ~2-3 seconds vs <500ms for Realtime

## What You Should Do Now

1. **Test in Azure OpenAI Studio** (5 minutes)
   - https://oai.azure.com/
   - Try voice mode with your `gpt-realtime` deployment
   - If it works there, we need to fix the API call
   - If it doesn't work there, deployment has issues

2. **Check Your Azure Region**
   - Realtime API may not be available in East US yet
   - You may need to create a new resource in East US 2 or Sweden Central

3. **Alternative: I can implement STT + TTS solution**
   - Works everywhere
   - Uses Azure Speech Services + GPT-4o
   - Cheaper than Realtime API
   - ~2 second latency (still acceptable)

## My Recommendation

Since you need voice working NOW, I recommend:

**Option A (Best)**: Test in Azure OpenAI Studio first
- If it works there → I'll fix the API integration (30 mins)
- If it doesn't work → Deployment needs to be recreated in supported region

**Option B (Fastest)**: Switch to Speech-to-Text + GPT-4o + Text-to-Speech
- I can implement this in 1 hour
- Works immediately, no waiting for Azure
- Uses your existing `gpt-4o` deployment
- More affordable for 100+ students
- Code changes needed but straightforward

Let me know which option you prefer and I'll proceed immediately!
